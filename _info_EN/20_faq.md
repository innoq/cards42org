### How do I get the printed cards?

The first printed card packs are available at conferences where INNOQ is represented (such as DeveloperWeek, Goto conference or JAX).
When all 42 cards are ready, we are thinking about an online ordering option where you just have to pay the shipping fees.

### How was the idea born?

 Markus Harrer (the main contributor) went one evening (still deeply impressed by an internal INNOQ company event) to a bookstore and discovered ["50 Karten: Kunterbunte Mitmach-Karten für das Handgepäck"](https://www.usborne.de/usborne-verlag-buecher/katalog/produkt/5/8810/50-karten-kunterbunte-mitmach-karten-fuer-das-handgepaeck/) (rough translation: "50 cards: colourful acticity cards for your hand luggage").
 These cards were designed to encourage children to think about various things.
 Markus was heavily inspired by these cards and created first ideas for "Acitivity Cards for Software Architects".
 The cards42 project was born.

### Why the name "cards42"?

 With this name we follow the tradition of [Gernot Starke](https://www.innoq.com/en/staff/gernot-starke/) (INNOQ Fellow) in the naming process. Gernot has already created the projects [arc42](https://arc42.org/) and [aim42](https://www.aim42.org/). He also explained the origin of the number 42 [the origin of the number 42](https://faq.arc42.org/questions/A-1/).

*OK, and of course the domain was still available ;-)*

### Why is there an logo with "INNOQ" on the cards?

INNOQ is the company where the main contributors are employeed.
INNOQ gives the main contributors the time for creating and maintaining the cards42 project.
INNOQ is also printing the cards on real paper and distributes them on various occasions.
Mentioning INNOQ on the cards is the least that what we can do to say "thank you!".
