Often we have several hundred pages of documentation &ndash; and nobody seems to understand it or it is hopelessly out of date. As a result, little documentation is usually created or existing documentation is no longer being maintained. Rarely do we question the reasons for this lack of understanding. With our checklist you can verify in a few minutes whether the existing documentation is properly tailored to the target group and up to date. 

Please tick the appropriate box for each question that you can answer with a clear "Yes". Are there certain areas that are not OK? Then you already have the first hints where you can improve your documentation step by step. Ideally, you should do this check regularly, so that you can be sure that your documentation is always up to date and targeted.
