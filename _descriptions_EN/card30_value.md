You plan to integrate another new payment method into your system, but aren't you sure if nine weeks of development time can be spent on this?
Many of your users might be grateful to have a new opportunity. 
This will most likely have no noticeable impact on stakeholders,  but simultaneously prevents you from developing new features during this time.

You plan to integrate another new payment method into your system, but aren't you sure if nine weeks of development time can be spent on this?
