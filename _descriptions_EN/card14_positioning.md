Many teams are not aware of how great their software actually is and where dangers lurk for their success. The analysis of the current situation helps you to find unused opportunities and identify blind spots.

Discuss among yourselves with which strengths your software can score points:

* What has been going really well so far?
* What are you really proud of?

Also, ask yourself what weaknesses are currently present:

* Where are you struggling?
* What are you missing?

On this basis, look for opportunities to compensate for the weaknesses identified:

* What opportunities can you take in the near future?
* What can you change yourself right away?

Identify threats that are hidden in your software:

* What are the unfavorable developments in your environment?
* Where are the possible threats?
