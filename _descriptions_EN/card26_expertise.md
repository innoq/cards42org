None of us can do everything, but surely each of us can do something especially well.
Sharing this special knowledge helps you to make your team even better
and reduce knowledge islands.

So, what is your ultimate subject of expertise? Write down this topic on a card &ndash; each and every one for themselves &ndash; and think about which five guides, books, blogs, or other resources have helped you to get into the subject. Sorts them, starting with the most basic entry resource, and  write them on the card as well.

Afterwards you can discuss your results. Maybe someone else chose this topic as well and nobody was aware of it?  Awesome! 

After all, this results in a greater accumulation of knowledge and perhaps also varying learning resources.
Ideally, collect the filled out cards in a location that is accessible to everyone in the team.
This allows everyone to access the learning resources and expand their knowledge at any time.
