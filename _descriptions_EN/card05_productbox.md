Often the vision or the goal is missing in aging software systems. What is the right path? For whom are we doing all this? Does it even make sense anymore?

The product box helps you to find important answers for your software from the customers' point of view:

* What is actually being developed?
* Who has the benefit?
* What are the central selling points and reasons for use?
* What are the core functions?
* What is the unique selling proposition of the product compared to other products or the previous version?

By answering such questions you will get a better understanding of what you are really developing the software for.
