The vision or the goal is often missing in aging software systems. What is the right path? For whom are we doing all this? Does it even make sense anymore?

The product box helps you to find meaningful answers for your software from the customers' point of view:

* What is actually being developed?
* Who has the benefit?
* What are the central selling points and reasons for use?
* What are the core functions?
* What is the unique selling point of your product (compared to other products or the previous version)?

You will better understand what you are creating software for by answering these questions.
