<q>The system is too complex to sketch it out in a brief! </q> &ndash; this or something along those lines has certainly been a phrase every developer has heard before.

However, a well-structured and clear software architecture must fit on a beer coaster.

Try to sketch the most important aspects of your architecture on this card.

* When do you encounter space limitations? Do you have too much unnecessary burden?
* Does it get too detailed in some places? Could the system be abstracted in different ways?
* Don't you even know what you are supposed to draw? Are essential architectural elements not known?

Discuss your drawing approach as well as the outcome. Think about what measures you can take to structure your software system even more clearly.
