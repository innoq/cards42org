Often there are very obvious solutions in front of us, which contribute significantly to the success of a software system, but we do not see them yet. We are too much caught with our narrow-mindedness in our daily business.

This card solves this dilemma by deliberately taking you into the distant future. This opens up a completely different perspective on "today then", as you now look back on the present.

Once you have arrived in the future, collect the TOP 3 actions that have happened to make your software system really successful. Discuss afterwards, again in the here and now, why you haven't taken the actions yet:

* What needs to happen to make you better off?
* What happens just before?
* What happens up next?
* How can you start now?
