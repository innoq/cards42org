We are often trapped in our own world with all its restrictions. We are conditioned to be modest &ndash; this leads to solutions that are modest as well.

But what if you only had infinite resources (time, money, people, ...)? What would you then do with your software system? What is the maximum amount of meaningful resources that still make sense? How far away are you from getting those? What valuable resources can you get your hands on today that make your software system tremendously better?

Collect the opportunities on this map and discuss them with your team!
