You are stuck with a challenging problem?
You have to implement something swiftly, but are stuck in your thoughts?
You are desperate because you lack the most simple ideas?

Ask yourself: What would a person you admire do in your situation?

- What would Margaret Hamilton say about your "challenges" in developing and implementing reliable software?
- How would James Bond eliminate performance bottlenecks with the database?
- What would the Cookie Monster do with your numerous zombie tickets?

Get out of your pitfall by consciously creating a different perspective on your problems!
