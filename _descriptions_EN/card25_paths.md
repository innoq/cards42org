Every day, decisions are taken which often have a long-term impact on our software.
design. Each of these decisions is based on several alternatives, of which, however, only one can ever be selected as a solution approach.
The selected solution is usually described in an architecture documentation and is therefore comprehensible. But what about the alternatives, which have also been considered but were not chosen?These should also be documented so that the decisions made can be understood in the long term.


Now, think about which paths you deliberately did not follow in your software.
Write them down on the card and describe what the reasons for the rejection of the individual alternative was. You can use the results of this map to create **Architecture Decision Records** for your software to make its history more comprehensible.
