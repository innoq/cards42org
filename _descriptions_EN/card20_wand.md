In a fantasy world, if the conjurer knows the real name of the evil sheâ€™s confronting,
she can unsummon the demon with a flick of her wand.
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to do the same, only with our software systems? 

Unfortunately, we developers are left without such a magical device.
Even if we do know the root of evil in our software, there is rarely &mdash; or even never &mdash; a quick solution at hand. It takes a lot of hard work to improve our software system at least a little bit.

But maybe this image of a conjurer's wand will help you reflect on your system while you're waving the card.
Think about the fixes your spell could provide.
And then discuss the results with your team.

Who knows, maybe you might even come up with a magical idea that could solve a problem or two.
