In a fantasy world, if the conjurer knows the real name of the evil she’s confronting,
she can unsummon the demon with a flick of her wand.
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to do the same, only with our software systems? 

Unfortunately, we developers are left without such a magical device.
Even if we do know the root of evil in our software, there is rarely&mdash;or never, even&mdash;a quick solution at hand. It takes a lot of hard work to improve our software
at least a little bit.

But maybe this image of a conjurer's wand will help you reflect on your system,
while you're waving its card around.
Think about the fixes your spell could provide, given the chance.
And then discuss the results with your team. 

Who knows, you might even come up with a magical idea that could solve a problem or two.
