Important quality attribute goals significantly determine decision-making in the implementation of software systems. In this quick check, you can compare your TOP 3 quality goals with the implemented solution to check if they fit together.

Find out first what the TOP quality attribute goals are. Then identify the essential architectural principles of your software system. These are the things you would tell a tech-savvy person who wants to know how you have designed the software. Then estimate how well the respective architecture principle supports (or contradicts) the achievement of a quality attribute goal.
