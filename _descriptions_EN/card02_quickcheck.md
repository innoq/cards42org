Important quality attribute goals significantly determine decision-making in the implementation of software systems. In this quick check, you can compare your top 3 quality goals with the implemented solutions to check if they fit together.

Find out first what the top quality attribute goals are. Then identify the essential architectural approaches of your software system. These are all the technical stuff you would talk about with a tech-savvy person who wants to know how you have designed your software system. Then estimate how well the respective architecture approach supports (or contradicts) the fullfilment of a quality goal.

If they don't match, double-check that your quality goals are still the right ones or if you've chosen the wrong approaches for your software system.
