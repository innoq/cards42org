Writing documentation is one of the most unpopular tasks in software development. Very frequently the importance of documentation is not appreciated or dismissed as cumbersome.

A good documentation not only helps others, but also benefits the person writing it. Writing and updating the documentation does not have to be witchcraft, it can be done parallel to the development &ndash; even within the already running development environment. Using arc42 provides a solid foundation for good and easy documentation of software architectures.
