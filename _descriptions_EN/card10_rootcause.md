Software developers solve hundreds of small and large issues on a daily basis. We are therefore conditioned to work out solutions quickly. However, in some challenging situations this is counterproductive. We often react with our trained solution repertoire to the first apparent problem that seems obvious to us.

This card should help you to overcome this initial instinct, whereby you first find out the real problems by asking targeted <q>why?</q> questions.

Try to use the so called "5 Whys" in tricky situations, in order to not only constantly solve symptoms, but to tackle the root causes of the problem at the right time.
