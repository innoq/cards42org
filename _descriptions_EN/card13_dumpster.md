In many cases, one does not think about what led to the often fatal outcome until after the end of a project. In agile projects, retrospectives are also held to identify risks for a project at an early stage, but these are often limited to the events of the past few weeks.

In both cases, we could happily work our way through until we get a hard cut in the form of a project termination &ndash; which we can't even explain to ourselves at that point.

But why does it have to come to this point? Think about what could cause your product to hit the wall in the near future. Do this for different periods of time so that you are not trapped in the here and now. Then use this knowledge to define and implement suitable countermeasures.
