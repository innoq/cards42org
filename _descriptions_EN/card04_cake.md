<q>The day has 24h and then there is the night, too.</q> &mdash; A former professor of Markus.

...and suddenly the day was over. But what did you get done? This pie chart can help you see what you've been spending your precious time on:


* Are you using your time effectively?
* Which of the time slots can you simply get rid of?
* Are you achieving maximum utilization of your time?

Assess the time you spent! See if others determine how you work or if you have control over your own time:

* How much time do you invest in future-oriented work?
* How much time do you expend on unplanned work?
* How much time is spent on routine tasks?
