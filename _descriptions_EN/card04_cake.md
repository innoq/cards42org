...and suddenly the day was gone. But what did you get done? This time pie chart can help you see what you've been spending your precious time on:


* Are you using your time effectively?
* Which of the time slots can you simply get rid of?
* Are you achieving maximum utilization of your time?

Assess the time you spend according to whether you are driven by a workload or whether you have control over your own time:


* How much time do you invest in future-oriented work?
* How much time do you expend on unplanned work?
* How much time is spent on routine tasks?
