Similar to horror movies, there are also monsters in software development. They don't cost you your life, but they do cost you a lot of time, nerves and in the worst case even money. God objects upon which a huge application depends, switch statements with countless entries or a parameter list which takes up half the screen: all these are monsters we may encounter every day. What does your personal code-smell monster look like? Draw it on the card and think about how you can defeat it.
