In software systems which has been under development for a long time, it becomes very difficult over time to understand decisions made in the past. Therefore it is important to document decisions and their motives in an understandable way.

With the help of Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs), it is possible to document decisions in the lightest and most consistent way possible. In addition, the motivation for a decision and the thought processes that have been followed as well as the context (time, knowledge, participants, etc.) are recorded here.


With this template you could practice structuring your decisions according to the ideas of the ADRs.
