Although we hate to hear it: risks are part of our projects from the very first moment.
Often, however, both these risks and their countermeasures are forgotten to be documented accordingly.
This can later have fatal consequences if, for example, you have relied on too fragile adjacent systems, or perhaps also ignored relevant regulatory issues.

Think about the risks in your project and document one risk per card. 
Afterwards, write down the measures you have taken to minimize the risk and the expected impact.

Discuss the results with each other. Perhaps you have discovered a previously unknown risk?
Very good! Now you can make your project a bit safer and extend the architecture documentation.
In addition, you can raise the awareness of both yourself and affected stakeholders.
