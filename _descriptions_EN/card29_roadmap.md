Recognize this? You've just returned from a conference and would like to put all this new stuff into practice right now. But then you think about it, and realize something is stopping you: all the old stuff you have!

It's often the existing constraints that make it difficult (at least for now) to update the tech stack. But how can you make it visible early on that you already have some new stuff in mind?

This card can help you to keep a clear head instead of despairing and throwing in the towel early. Explain what technology you perceive at which stage of adaptation. Do not only assess the new trendy topics that you find interesting for your software, but also try to match already used technology to one of the following stages and thus communicate the current view on the technologies:

1. **Hold on**: Already heard, doesn't really fit to us yet
2. **Consider**: Could be interesting, we'll find out more
3. **Test**: There's a good use case that we're implementing
4. **Utilize**: Yes, it's worked out well, we're adding it to our standard portfolio
5. **Stop**: Okay, we're gonna get out of here.
6. **Dispose**: Everywhere we stumble on it, it gets removed
